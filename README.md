TO MY GRADER:

In order to run this app, your device or emulator MUST have the latest version of Google Play Store installed. 

To get google play store: I used Genymotion Emulator and installed the play store by downloading a zip file from http://opengapps.org/ (with platform: x86, android: 6.0, variant: nano) and dragging and dropping the zip file directly to the emulator and then flashing and restarting it.

To test the app, you can either create an account and try to add your own classes and gaps, or if you want to test all the functionality that the application provides, I would recommend signing in with these credentials:
